# VisioText ERNIE

## 📝 Description
**VisioText ERNIE** is a lightweight web application that transforms PDF documents into accessible web pages.  
It uses **PaddleOCR-VL** to extract text and layout, converts the content into **Markdown**, and leverages **ERNIE AI** to generate a static web page deployed on **GitHub Pages**.

## 🚀 Demo

## ✨ Inspiration
Many scanned documents and PDFs contain valuable information locked in visual form.  
This project aims to unlock that content and make it navigable, accessible, and meaningful through OCR and language models.

---

## ⚙️ How it works
1. **Upload PDF** → The user provides a document.  
2. **OCR with PaddleOCR-VL** → Text and layout are extracted into JSON.  
3. **Conversion to Markdown** → Headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and images are preserved.  
4. **Generation with ERNIE** → Markdown is transformed into a semantic, responsive web page.  
5. **Deployment on GitHub Pages** → The result is published as a public demo.
